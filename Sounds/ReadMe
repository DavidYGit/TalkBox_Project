This file contains instructions on how to provide the sound files to TalkBox. 

You can supply TalkBox with a maximum of two sets of sounds, each of 10 individual sounds.

Copy your sounds to the two folders in the Sounds folder. 

In each folder name and number your sounds, S1, S2, ...

If you don't want a set to contain sounds leave the folder empty. If S1 doesn't exist in the folder, it only uses Set 1.
